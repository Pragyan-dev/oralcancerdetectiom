## Overview
This repository provides a pipeline for building and deploying a machine learning model to detect oral cancer from images (such as tissue scans or intraoral photographs). The project includes:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Model training and evaluation scripts.
3. Example notebooks demonstrating how to use and test the model.
4. (Optional) Deployment scripts for using the model in a web or local application.

## Features
- **Automated Preprocessing**: Scripts to resize, normalize, and augment oral lesion images.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) that classifies images into cancerous or non-cancerous.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tools to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data exploration, training curves, and confusion matrices.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pragyan-dev/oralcancerdetectiom.git
   cd oralcancerdetectiom
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Configure your GPU**:  
   If you plan to train on a GPU, ensure that you have the correct CUDA and related drivers installed and that your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) is GPU-enabled.
